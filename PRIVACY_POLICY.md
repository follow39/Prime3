## Introduction

Artem Ivanov ("we," "our," or "us") respects your privacy and is committed to protecting your personal data. This privacy policy explains how Prime3 ("the App") handles your information.

## Data Collection

### What We Collect

**Prime3 does NOT collect, transmit, or store any personal data on external servers.**

All data is stored locally on your device:
- Your daily goals and tasks
- Task completion status and history
- Your day schedule preferences (start/end times)
- App settings and preferences
- Premium subscription status (if applicable)

### What We Do NOT Collect

We do not collect:
- Personal identification information (name, email, phone number)
- Location data
- Device information
- Usage analytics
- Advertising identifiers
- Any data that could identify you

## Data Storage

### Local Storage Only

All data is stored exclusively on your device using:
- **SQLite Database**: Stores tasks and goals locally
- **Local Storage**: Stores user preferences and settings
- **Capacitor Preferences**: Stores app configuration

### No Cloud Sync

Prime3 does not sync your data to any cloud service or external server. Your data never leaves your device.

## Data Security

- All data is stored locally using industry-standard SQLite encryption (iOS)
- No network transmission of personal data
- No third-party access to your data
- Your goals and tasks are completely private

## Third-Party Services

Prime3 does not integrate with any third-party analytics, advertising, or tracking services.

## Notifications

Prime3 uses local notifications to remind you about your daily goals:
- Notifications are generated entirely on your device
- No data is transmitted when notifications are sent
- You can disable notifications in the app settings

## In-App Purchases (If Applicable)

If you make an in-app purchase:
- Payment processing is handled by Apple App Store
- We do not collect or store your payment information
- Purchase receipts are validated with Apple servers
- We only receive confirmation of purchase, not payment details

## Your Rights

Because we don't collect any personal data, there is no data to:
- Access
- Modify
- Delete
- Export

All your data is already under your complete control on your device.

## Data Deletion

Prime3 data is automatically backed up to iCloud as part of your device backup (if iCloud Backup is enabled in your device settings). This means your data will be restored if you reinstall the app.

To completely delete all Prime3 data:
1. Use the "Clear All Data" option in app settings
2. Uninstall the app from your device
3. Delete the app data from your iCloud backup:
   - Go to Settings → [Your Name] → iCloud → Manage Storage → Backups
   - Select your device → Show All Apps
   - Turn off Prime3 to remove it from future backups
   - Or delete the entire device backup to remove all app data

Note: Data is stored locally on your device and backed up via standard iOS iCloud backup. No separate cloud sync service is used.

## Children's Privacy

Prime3 does not knowingly collect data from children under 13. The app does not collect any personal information from any users, regardless of age.

## Changes to This Policy

We may update this privacy policy from time to time. Changes will be posted in the app with an updated "Last Updated" date.

## International Users

Prime3 stores all data locally on your device, regardless of your location. No data is transferred internationally because no data leaves your device.

## California Privacy Rights (CCPA)

Because Prime3 does not collect personal information, CCPA data rights requests do not apply. You have complete control over your local data at all times.

## GDPR Compliance (EU Users)

Prime3 is GDPR-compliant by design:
- No personal data is collected
- No data processing occurs on external servers
- No data controllers or processors are involved
- All data remains under your control on your device
